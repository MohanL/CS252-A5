How to run:
./ProxyServer (somenumber)
then the proxy server would start

in another session of cycle1
type in
telnet 127.0.0.1 (samenumber as above)
GET www.foo.com/mumbo.html HTTP/1.1

and it will output something from the real server.

which techically should be the same as you do this :
telnet www.foo.com 80
GET /mumbo.html HTTP/1.1
host:www.foo.com

Problems :
I parsed the URI in a wrong way.
for example
www.abc.com/a/d/c.html would be parsed as www.abc/c.html.
it is because I used a while loop. I should use two function calls to fix it.
