How to run:
./ProxyServer (somenumber)
then the proxy server would start

in another session of cycle1
type in
telnet 127.0.0.1 (samenumber as above)
GET www.foo.com/mumbo.html HTTP/1.1

and it will output something from the real server.

which techically should be the same as you do this :
telnet www.foo.com 80
GET /mumbo.html HTTP/1.1
host:www.foo.com

Problems :
the chunked output is the same maybe one extra \r\n ?
basical functionalities aredone and tested.

could not pass the concurrent test from the python script. manully tested it, it works.
