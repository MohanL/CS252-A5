what I have implmented :
    1. client socket.
    2. a simple echo server that returns whatever he receives.

what I need to implement :
    2.     modify the request                                done.
    2.0.5  create new client socket                          done
    2.1    sends requests to the dest server.                done
    3.     modify read so that it reconstructs the request.  where is my output ??


Goal: first get output from the remote server back to proxy server than back to local server done.

Problem : the format, I am not sure how to format it in the right way.

          2. single thread, but multiple requests, how do I implement that ?
