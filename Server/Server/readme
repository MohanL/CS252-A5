what I have implmented :
    1. client socket.
    2. a simple echo server that returns whatever he receives.

what I need to implement :
    2.     modify the request                              done.
    2.0.5  create new client socket
    2.1    sends requests to the dest server.
    3.     modify read so that it reconstructs the request.
