what I have implmented :
    1. client socket.
    2. a simple echo server that returns whatever he receives.

what I need to implement :
    2.     modify the request                                done.
    2.0.5  create new client socket                          done
    2.1    sends requests to the dest server.                done
    3.     modify read so that it reconstructs the request.  where is my output ??


Goal: first get output from the remote server back to proxy server than back to local server done.

Problem : the format, I am not sure how to format it in the right way.

          2. single thread, but multiple requests, how do I implement that ?


Fixed: for a while, I have been worring about my parse line stuff, today I am going to thoroughtly test it out.
         test cases : a. w/o http
                      GET www.foo.com/mumbo.html HTTP/1.1               passed
                      GET http://www.foo.com/mumbo.html HTTP/1.1        passed
                      GET http://www.foo.com HTTP/1.1                   passed
                      GET www.foo.com HTTP/1.1                          passed

                      b. dynamic stuff.
                      GET www.foo.com/cgi-bin/adder?1&2 HTTP/1.1        passed

Concern: chunked transfer coding. I have never actually test it on really large websites. only small ones like www.foo.com
so what is left is about processing the message received from the remote server and (process itside in the proxy server) and send them back
