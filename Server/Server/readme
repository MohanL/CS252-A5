what I have implmented :
    1. client socket.
    2. a simple echo server that returns whatever he receives.

what I need to implement :
    2.     modify the request                                done.
    2.0.5  create new client socket                          done
    2.1    sends requests to the dest server.                done
    3.     modify read so that it reconstructs the request.  where is my output ??


Goal: first get output from the remote server back to proxy server than back to local server done.

Problem : the format, I am not sure how to format it in the right way.

          2. single thread, but multiple requests, how do I implement that ?


Concern: for a while, I have been worring about my parse line stuff, today I am going to thoroughtly test it out.
         test cases : a. w/o http
                      GET www.foo.com/mumbo.html HTTP/1.1               passed
                      GET http://www.foo.com/mumbo.html HTTP/1.1        passed
                      GET http://www.foo.com HTTP/1.1
                      GET www.foo.com HTTP/1.1 
                      I also need to prepare a case for nothing following the host name, which should directly go for home.html


                      b. static and dynamic stuff.
                      Here I need to incorporate the parse_uri and read functions .
