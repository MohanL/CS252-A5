      *                     the listen function to tell the kernel that the descriptor will be used by a server instead of a client.
      * therefore, listen is a function that can convert a active socket to a passive socket that can accept connection requests from clients.
      * The backlog argument is a hint about the number of outstanding connection requests that the kernel should queue up before
      * it starts to refuse requests, based on cycle1 and cycle1's limit, we set this number to be relatively small comparing to a real webserver.
